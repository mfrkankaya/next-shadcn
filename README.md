This is a boilerplate project using Next.js, Tailwind and [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui).

Using [class-variance-authority](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva), [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx), [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) to create components. (shadcn created and I modify them when needed)

With the power of [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) and [usehooks-ts](https://github.com/juliencrn/usehooks-ts).
